# 1. Udacity AB testing
### week 1 Overview: Example: Metrics

customer funnel: homepage visit; explore the site; create account; start a class

##### Case: Initial hypothesis: Changing the "start Now" button from orange to Pink will increase how many students explore audacity's courses

1. Choose a metric

a. total number of courses completed? (take too much time) 

b. number of clicks?  

c. click through rate = number of clicks /number of page views

##### d. click through probability = unique visitors who click / unique visitors to page (good)

##### Case: Updated hypothesis: Changing the "start Now" button from orange to Pink will increase the click-through-probability of the button

###### Rate: usability of a button; probability: impact on users

2. Review statistics

3. Design

4. Analysis


In practice, an A/B test can be summarized into the 5 steps below:

1. Choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, i.e. what do you care about, how do you want to measure the effect

2. Choose significance level (alpha), statistical power (1-beta) and practical significance level you really want to launch the change if the test is statistically significant

3. calculate required sample size

4. take sample for control/treatment groups and run the test

5. Analyze the results and draw valid conclusions
