# 1. Udacity AB testing
### week 1 Overview: Example: Metrics

customer funnel: homepage visit; explore the site; create account; start a class

##### Case: Initial hypothesis: Changing the "start Now" button from orange to Pink will increase how many students explore audacity's courses

1. Choose a metric

a. total number of courses completed? (take too much time) 

b. number of clicks?  

c. click through rate = number of clicks /number of page views

##### d. click through probability = unique visitors who click / unique visitors to page (good)

##### Case: Updated hypothesis: Changing the "start Now" button from orange to Pink will increase the click-through-probability of the button

###### Rate: usability of a button; probability: impact on users

2. Review statistics

3. Design

4. Analysis


In practice, an A/B test can be summarized into the 5 steps below:

1. Choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, i.e. what do you care about, how do you want to measure the effect

2. Choose significance level (alpha), statistical power (1-beta) and practical significance level you really want to launch the change if the test is statistically significant

3. calculate required sample size

4. take sample for control/treatment groups and run the test

5. Analyze the results and draw valid conclusions

### week 2 policy and ethics for experiments


### week 3 Choosing and Characterizing metrics

##### 1. Metrics for Experiments
##### 2. Define
##### 3. Build intuition
##### 4. Characterize

### Week 4 Design an Experiments

##### 1. Choose Subject
Assign the event to the Control or the Experiment
##### 2. Choose Population
##### 3. Size
##### 4. Duration

### Week 5 Analyzing results

### Week 6 Final Project


# 2. Udemy AB Testing

## 1. Bayesian A/B Testing （Feb 15 2018）LayProgrammer's course

Code: https://github.com/ritaxiaotian/machine_learning_examples

There are many interesting statistical concenpts in this course: The Monty Hall problem, imbalanced likelihood-Mean of a Gaussian, confidence intervals, etc.
#### Week 1 Introduction and outline
#### Week 2 Bayes Rules and Probability review
Bayes Rule

Monty Hall

Imbalanced Classes

Maximum Likelihood-Mean of a Gaussian: problem: unceritainty: give no information of whether we have collected enough data

Maximum Likelihood-Click Through Rate: frequentist way(Confidence Interval) v.s. Bayesian way

Confidence intervals:

Bayesian Paradigm

#### Week 3 Traditional A/B Testing
test characteriztics, assumptions, and modifications

t-test, CTR A/B test, Chi-Square, Statisticl Power, Pitfalls, etc

#### Week 4 Bayesian A/B testing
#### Week 5 Practice
