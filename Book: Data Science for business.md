# CHAPTER 2 Business Problems and Data Science Solutions

P44. A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known
task for which tools are available.

    1. Classification and class probability estimation attempt to predict, for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes this individual belongs to.
    
    2. Regression (“value estimation”) attempts to estimate or predict, for each individual, the numerical value of some variable for that individual.
    
    3. Similarity matching attempts to identify similar individuals based on data known about them.
    
    4. Clustering attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity,but not driven by any specific purpose.
    
    5. Co-occurrence grouping (also known as frequent itemset mining, association rule discovery, and market-basket analysis) attempts to find associations between entities based on transactions involving them.
