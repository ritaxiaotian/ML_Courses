In practice, an A/B test can be summarized into the 5 steps below:

1. Choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, i.e. what do you care about, how do you want to measure the effect

2. Choose significance level (alpha), statistical power (1-beta) and practical significance level you really want to launch the change if the test is statistically significant

3. calculate required sample size

4. take sample for control/treatment groups and run the test

5. Analyze the results and draw valid conclusions
