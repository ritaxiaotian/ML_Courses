## Week 1

  CS109 Key Facets

    • data munging/scraping/sampling/cleaning in order to get an informative, manageable data set;

    • data storage and management in order to be able to access data quickly and reliably during subsequent analysis;

    • exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data;

    • prediction based on statistical tools such as regression, classification, and clustering; and

    • communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.
