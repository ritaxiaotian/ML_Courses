## 1. Scientists as Designers （p1 － p14）

Necessary Ingredients in any Science Presentation:

  Scientific Content + Visual Information + Delivery
  
  Summary: Don’ts and Dos
  
      Don’t assume that great science speaks for itself.
      Do complement great content with a well-designed and well-delivered presentation.
      
      Don’t confuse design with decoration or meaningless visual elements.
      Do eliminate unimportant visual elements and anything that distracts from your message.
      
      Don’t be intimidated by the concept of design.
      Do embrace design as a process, a way for you to improve communication with your audience.
      
      Don’t confuse a simple scientific presentation with one that is easy, mediocre, or boring.
      Do appreciate the benefits of subtracting meaningless elements from presentations so that only important details remain.
      
      Don’t consider design principles as rules that limit freedom or creativity.
      Do learn the value of design guidelines and realize that it is okay to break them when it benefits your presentation.
      
      Don’t ignore the design around you, inside and out of your scientific institution.
      Do incorporate the good design of others into your own practice of design.
      
      Don’t consider the design of a presentation something that will be perfect when finished.
      Do regard design as a continuous process from which you and your presentations consistently grow.
      
## 2 Design Goals for Different Presentation Formats （p15 － p21）

    Summary: Don’ts and Dos
      Don’t assume that the only goal of a science presentation is to communicate science.
      Do consider the additional goals of various presentation formats, such as meeting collaborators, inspiring discussion, soliciting feedback, motivating  audiences, and networking.
      
      Don’t ignore the specific advantages and disadvantages of each presentation format.
      Do design to the strengths of a specific format while doing your best to make up for the limitations.
      
      Don’t assume your presentation will succeed because you have great content.
      Do consider the best ways of succeeding in your specific format while deliberately avoiding common pitfalls that afflict other presenters.
      
      Don’t design a science presentation for one format as you would for another.
      Do be mindful of the design considerations of each.
