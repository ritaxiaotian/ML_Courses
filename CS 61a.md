## Lecture 2: Names

An environment is a sequence of frames.
A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found.

    Call expression

    Calling/Applying

An environment is a sequence of frames.
• The global frame alone
• A local, then the global frame

Miscellaneous Python Features

## Lecture 4 HIgher-order fucntions

Lambda expressions are not common in Python, but important in general
Lambda expressions in Python cannot contain statements at all!

Environment diagrams

Environment Diagrams for Nested Def Statements

• Every user-defined function has a parent frame (often global)

• The parent of a function is the frame in which it was defined

• Every local frame has a parent frame (often global)

• The parent of a frame is the parent of the function called

How to draw an environment diagram

1. Add a local frame, titled with the <name> of the function being called.
    
2. Copy the parent of the function to the local frame: [parent=<label>]
    
3. Bind the <formal parameters> to the arguments in the local frame.
    
4. Execute the body of the function in the environment that starts with the local frame.
