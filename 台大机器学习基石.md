# Week 1 The Learning Problem

    1. When machine learning
            1.1 exists some 'underlying pattern to be learned' - so that performance measure can be improved
            
            1.2 but no programmable (easy) definition - so that ML is needed
            
            1.3 somehow there is data about the pattern - so that ML has some inputs to learn from

    2. Why machine learning

    3. How can machine learning

    4. How can machine learn better
    
    Components of machine learning
    
    1. Input
    
    2. Output
    
    3. unknown pattern to be learned
    
    4. data: training examples
    
    5. hypothesis: skill with hopefully good performance
    
    

# Week 2 Learning to Answer Yes/No

    1. Perceptron Hyothesis Set
    
    2. Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)
    
    3. Guarantee of PLA
    
    4. Non-seperable Data
