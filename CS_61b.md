      1. Before Java variables can be used, they must de declared
      
      2. Java variables must have a specific type
      
      3. Java variable types can never change
      
      4. Types are verified before the code even runs!!!
      
      
      1. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java

      A function that is part of a class is called a method

      So in Java, all functions are methods

      2. To define a function in Java, we use "public static". We will see alternative ways of defining functions later

      3. All parameters of a function must have a declared type, and the return value of the function must have a declared type
      functions in java return only one value!
