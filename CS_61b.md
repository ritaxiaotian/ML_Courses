      1. Before Java variables can be used, they must de declared
      
      2. Java variables must have a specific type
      
      3. Java variable types can never change
      
      4. Types are verified before the code even runs!!!
      
      
      
## Lecture 2: Defining and Using Classes

      1. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java

      A function that is part of a class is called a method

      So in Java, all functions are methods

      2. To define a function in Java, we use "public static". We will see alternative ways of defining functions later

      3. All parameters of a function must have a declared type, and the return value of the function must have a declared type
      functions in java return only one value!
      
 ## Lecture 3: References, Recursion, and Lists
 
#### Bits: Your computer stores information in “memory”.
      Information is stored in memory as a sequence of ones and zeros.
      Example: 72 stored as 01001000
      Example: 205.75 stored as … 01000011 01001101 11000000 00000000
      Example: The letter H stored as 01001000 (same as the number 72)
      Example: True stored as 00000001

      Each Java type has a different way to interpret the bits:
      8 primitive types in Java: ** byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char**
      We won’t discuss the precise representations in much detail in 61B.
      Covered in much more detail in 61C.
